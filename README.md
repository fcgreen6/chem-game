# **Chemistry Game** (Demo Video: https://youtu.be/Ac4t5nIyQHg)

## **Game Description:**
- A game based on covalent and ionic bonds in chemistry. This quarter I struggled in chemistry class quite a bit, so I decided to make a game based on a chemistry concept. In my game, you place atoms on the field to create chemical compounds and score points. To make things even more interesting, I added three unique strategy related abilities.

## **How to Run:**
- **Install Rust and Cargo:** The game is written in Rust. You must install the programming language and package manager. 
- **Clone Repo:** Clone the game repo to your machine. 
- **Navigate to Directory:** Move to the directory where the game is located.
- **Cargo Run:** Use the command “cargo run” to run the package.

## **How to Play:**
- **Chemistry Background:** To play my game, you need to know some background about chemistry. This is not a comprehensive list of what you should know, but hopefully it is enough to understand the game. 
  - **Atomic Number:** The number of protons that an atom has. Each element has a different atomic number.
  - **The Periodic Table:** The periodic table is a way of organizing elements in chemistry. Elements are arranged according to their atomic number in ascending order. For example, in the representation below, you can see that hydrogen (H) has an atomic number of one.

    The rows on the periodic table are called periods and the columns are called groups. When it comes to groups, you can ignore the elements in the center of the periodic table as shown in the diagram above.
